JOUR,"AIMS: The association between heart failure and dementia remains unclear. We assessed the risk of dementia among patients with heart failure and members of a general population comparison cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual-level data from Danish medical registries were linked in this nationwide population-based cohort study comparing patients with a first-time hospitalization for heart failure between 1980 and 2012 and a year of birth-, sex-, and calendar year-matched comparison cohort from the general population. Stratified Cox regression analysis was used to compute 1-35-year hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of all-cause dementia and, secondarily, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias. Analyses included 324 418 heart failure patients and 1 622 079 individuals from the general population (median age 77 years, 52% male). Compared with the general population cohort, risk of all-cause dementia was increased among heart failure patients [adjusted HR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.24]. The associations were stronger in men and in heart failure patients under age 70. Heart failure patients had higher risks of vascular dementia (adjusted HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.40-1.59) and other dementias (adjusted HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.26-1.34) than members of the general population cohort. Heart failure was not associated with Alzheimer's disease (adjusted HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.04). CONCLUSION: Heart failure was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND: Data on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cognitive decline are conflicting. Our objective was to investigate if CVD is associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and to examine whether hypertension, diabetes, or adiposity modify the effect of CVD on cognitive functioning. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective follow-up of 6455 cognitively intact, postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years old enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS). CVD was determined by self-report. For cognitive decline, we assessed the incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or probable dementia (PD) via modified mini-mental state examination (3 MS) score, neurocognitive, and neuropsychiatric examinations. The median follow-up was 8.4 years. Women with CVD tended to be at increased risk for cognitive decline compared with those free of CVD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.67). Women with myocardial infarction or other vascular disease were at highest risk (HR, 2.10; 95% CI: 1.40, 3.15 or HR, 1.97; 95% CI: 1.34, 2.87). Angina pectoris was moderately associated with cognitive decline (HR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.01) whereas no significant relationships were found for atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Hypertension and diabetes increased the risk for cognitive decline in women without CVD. Diabetes tended to elevate the risk for MCI/PD in women with CVD. No significant trend was seen for adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: CVD is associated with cognitive decline in elderly postmenopausal women. Hypertension and diabetes, but not adiposity, are associated with a higher risk for cognitive decline. More research is warranted on the potential of CVD prevention for preserving cognitive functioning.",,"['Haring, B.', 'Leng, X.', 'Robinson, J.', 'Johnson, K. C.', 'Jackson, R.

JOUR,"OBJECTIVE: To examine if risk factors for cerebrovascular disease would increase the risk for dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Non-demented patients were recruited from an epidemiological study of PD in the county of Rogaland, Norway. PD and dementia were diagnosed according to strict diagnostic criteria. Established cerebrovascular risk factors were recorded at baseline, and their influence on incident dementia was assessed 4 years later using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 171 non-demented PD patients constituted the at-risk population. Seventy-two (55%) had at least one cerebrovascular risk factor. A total of 130 subjects (96% of survivors) completed the follow-up examination. Forty-three (33%) new cases of dementia were found. Twenty-five of the 72 (35%) patients with and 18 of the 58 (31%) subjects without any risk factor developed dementia (ns). A significant association with dementia was found for a diagnosis of heart failure in the univariate analyses. However, in the logistic regression analysis none of the cerebrovascular risk factors were significantly associated with incident dementia. CONCLUSIONS: In this large and representative cohort of patients with PD cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with incident dementia, indicating that the disease-related degenerative brain changes are the main causes of dementia in PD.",16281921,"['Haugarvoll, K.', 'Aarsland, D.', 'Wentzel-Larsen, T.', 'Larsen, J.

JOUR,"Vascular risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) have been evaluated; however, few studies have compared risks by dementia subtypes and sex. We evaluated relationships between cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and obesity), events (stroke, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and myocardial infarction), and subsequent risk of AD and VaD by sex in a community-based cohort of 3264 Cache County residents aged 65 or older. Cardiovascular history was ascertained by self-report or proxy-report in detailed interviews. AD and VaD were diagnosed using standard criteria. Estimates from discrete-time survival models showed no association between self-reported history of hypertension and high cholesterol and AD after adjustments. Hypertension increased the risk of VaD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-7.44]. Obesity increased the risk of AD in females (aHR 2.23, 95% CI 1.09-4.30) but not males. Diabetes increased the risk of VaD in females after adjustments (aHR 3.33, 95% CI 1.03-9.78) but not males. The risk of VaD after stroke was increased in females (aHR 16.90, 95% CI 5.58-49.03) and males (aHR 10.95, 95% CI 2.48-44.78). The results indicate that vascular factors increase risks for AD and VaD differentially by sex.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Men, but not women, with unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI) have an increased risk of cardiac events and stroke compared with those without MI or with recognized MI. We investigated whether unrecognized MI is also a risk factor for dementia and cerebral small vessel disease (white matter lesions and brain infarction) in 2 population-based cohort studies. METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, 6347 participants were classified at baseline (1990 to 1993) into those with recognized MI (subdivided into Q-wave and non-Q-wave MI), with unrecognized MI, and without MI based on electrocardiography and interview and were followed for incident dementia (n=613) until January 1, 2005. In the Rotterdam Scan Study, 436 nondemented persons were similarly classified based on electrocardiography and interview and underwent brain MRI for the assessment of white matter lesions and brain infarction. RESULTS: In men, unrecognized MI was associated with an increased risk of dementia (compared with men without MI hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.35) and with more white matter lesions and more often brain infarction on MRI. In women, no associations were found with unrecognized MI. Recognized MI was not associated with the risk of dementia in either sex. Men, but not women, with recognized MI had more often any brain infarction or asymptomatic brain infarction, especially if they had Q-wave MI. No consistent associations were found between recognized Q-wave or non-Q-wave MI and severity of white matter lesions. Additional adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors did not change the results.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional epidemiological and clinical research suggests that lower cardiac index is associated with abnormal brain aging, including smaller brain volumes, increased white matter hyperintensities, and worse cognitive performances. Lower systemic blood flow may have implications for dementia among older adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1039 Framingham Offspring Cohort participants free of clinical stroke, transient ischemic attack, and dementia formed our sample (age, 69+/-6 years; 53% women). Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazard models adjusting for Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, cardiovascular disease history, atrial fibrillation), education, and apolipoprotein E4 status related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-assessed cardiac index (cardiac output divided by body surface area) to incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD). Over the median 7.7-year follow-up period, 32 participants developed dementia, including 26 cases of AD. Each 1-SD unit decrease in cardiac index increased the relative risk of both dementia (hazard ratio [HR]=1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.47; P=0.013) and AD (HR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.07-2.54; P=0.022). Compared with individuals with normal cardiac index, individuals with clinically low cardiac index had a higher relative risk of dementia (HR=2.07; 95% CI, 1.02-4.19; P=0.044).

JOUR,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the prevalence, incidence and prognosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in a cohort of ambulatory older men and women. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal study of 10 years duration with ECGs obtained at baseline and on an annual basis. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A community-based cohort study consisting of 459 subjects (aged 75-85, mean age 79 years). MEASUREMENTS: Baseline and follow up ECGs were interpreted using the Minnesota Code. Prevalence and incidence of LVH and ECG were determined as well as regression of ECG LVH. Clinical event rates measured were incidence of total mortality, myocardial infarction (MI, fatal and non-fatal), cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease (fatal and non-fatal), stroke (fatal and non-fatal), all-cause dementia, and multi-infarct dementia. Differences in event rates between groups (those subjects with and without LVH) were compared as tests between proportions. A Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis was performed to compare the relative independent predictive values of different competing factors, including age, gender, serum cholesterol, digitalis use, body mass, index, Blessed Dementia Scale, cigarette smoking, LVH at baseline, LVH ar baseline (persisting), new LVH, new LVH (persisting), new LVH (regressed), previous MI by history of ECG, hypertension by history, and cardiomegaly by X-ray (cardiothoracic ratio > or = 50%). RESULTS: At baseline, 9.2% of subjects (n = 42) had LVH on ECG and a mortality rate of 11.7/100 persons years versus 4.9/100 persons years for subjects without baseline LVH (P < .0001), and MI rate of 7.5/100 persons years with LVH versus 2.6/100 persons years without LVH (P < .0001), and a cardiovascular mortality rate of 7.2/100 persons years without LVH versus 2.7/100 person years without LVH. Subjects who developed new LVH on ECG (n = 39) had a mortality rate of 14.4/100 person-years compared with 4.4/100 person-years for those without LVH (P < .0001), a cardiovascular mortality rate of 11.1/100 person years versus 2.0/100 person years without LVH (P < .0001), and an MI rate of 6.1/100 person years versus 2.0/100 person years without LVH (P < .01). Subjects in whom the ECG LVH pattern disappeared over time had fewer cardiovascular mortal and morbid events than those with persistent LVH. According to the regression analyses, persistent LVH from baseline was an independent predictor of MI, overall cardiovascular disease, and total mortality. Newly developing LVH with subsequent regression was an independent predictor of overall cardiovascular disease and death. CONCLUSIONS: An increased prevalence and incidence of LVH on ECG, irrespective cause, is associated with a poor prognosis in very old men and women. Regression of ECG LVH in older people, irrespective of cause, may confer improvement in risk for cardiovascular disease.",8617900,"['Kahn, S.', 'Frishman, W. H.', 'Weissman, S.', 'Ooi, W.

JOUR,"Objective: Growing evidence suggests that vascular risk factors (VRF) contribute to cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of VRF on the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. Methods: A total of 837 subjects with MCI were enrolled at baseline and followed up annually for 5 years. The incidence of AD dementia was investigated. A mixed random effects regression model was used to analyze the association between VRF and the progression of MCI assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination and instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify the association between VRF and dementia conversion, and to examine whether treatment of VRF can prevent dementia conversion. Results: At the end of the follow-up, 298 subjects converted to AD dementia, while 352 remained MCI. Subjects with VRF had a faster progression in cognition and function relative to subjects without. VRF including hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, and hypercholesterolemia increased the risk of dementia conversion. Those subjects with MCI in whom all VRF were treated had a lower risk of dementia than those who had some VRF treated. Treatment of individual VRF including hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia was associated with the reduced risk of AD conversion. Conclusion: VRF increased the risk of incident AD dementia. Treatment of VRF was associated with a reduced risk of incident AD dementia.

JOUR,"INTRODUCTION: An aging population brings increasing burdens and costs to individuals and society arising from late-life cognitive decline, the causes of which are unclear. We aimed to identify factors predicting late-life cognitive decline. METHODS: Participants were 889 community-dwelling 70-90-year-olds from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study with comprehensive neuropsychological assessments at baseline and a 2-year follow-up and initially without dementia. Cognitive decline was considered as incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, as well as decreases in attention/processing speed, executive function, memory, and global cognition. Associations with baseline demographic, lifestyle, health and medical factors were determined. RESULTS: All cognitive measures showed decline and 14% of participants developed incident MCI or dementia. Across all participants, risk factors for decline included older age and poorer smelling ability most prominently, but also more education, history of depression, being male, higher homocysteine, coronary artery disease, arthritis, low health status, and stroke. Protective factors included marriage, kidney disease, and antidepressant use. For some of these factors the association varied with age or differed between men and women. Additional risk and protective factors that were strictly age- and/or sex-dependent were also identified. We found salient population attributable risks (8.7-49.5%) for older age, being male or unmarried, poor smelling ability, coronary artery disease, arthritis, stroke, and high homocysteine. DISCUSSION: Preventing or treating conditions typically associated with aging might reduce population-wide late-life cognitive decline.

JOUR,"Introduction: Mild cognitive impairment does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of dementia, but reaching this diagnosis raises concern about the future state of a patient due to the possibility of the conversion to Alzheimer's disease. Although the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is neurodegenerative, the impact of vascular diseases is also taken into consideration. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vascular diseases in patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment on the conversion to Alzheimer's disease. Material and methods: In each of 101 patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, a detailed medical history was taken, taking into account: hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes as well as thyroid diseases, head injuries, alcohol abuse, smoking, exposure to toxic substances, surgery under general anaesthesia and the family character of dementia. Clinical follow-ups were scheduled after 6, 12 and 24 months. Results: Amongst 101 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 17 (16.8%) converted to Alzheimer's disease within two years of observation.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND: Gender differences for incidence of dementia among elderly people have been usually investigated considering gender as a predictor and not as a stratification variable. METHODS: Analyses were based on data collected by the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), which enrolled 5,632 participants aged 65-84 years between 1992 and 2000. During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, there were 194 cases of incident dementia in the participants with complete data. Cox proportional hazard models for competing risks, stratified by sex, were defined to determine risk factors in relation to developing dementia. RESULTS: The incidence rate of dementia increased from 5.57/1,000 person-years at 65-69 years of age to 30.06/1,000 person-years at 80-84 years. Cox proportional hazard models for competing risks of incidence of dementia and death revealed that, among men, significant risk factors were heart failure, Parkinson's disease, family history of dementia, mild depressive symptomatology and age, while triglycerides were associated with a lower risk of developing dementia. Significant risk factors in women were age, both mild and severe depressive symptomatology, glycemia >/=109 mg/dL, and a BMI < 24.1 kg/m(2). Even as little as three years of schooling was found to be a significant protective factor against the incidence of dementia only for women.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure has been linked to cognitive impairment in several previous studies, but to our knowledge, no investigations have explored the relationship between heart failure and the risk of dementia. We sought to examine the hypothesis that heart failure is a risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer disease. METHODS: A community-based cohort of 1301 individuals 75 years or older and without dementia in Stockholm, Sweden, was examined 3 times over a 9-year period to detect patients with dementia and Alzheimer disease using the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition. Heart failure was defined according to the guidelines of the Task Force on Heart Failure of the European Society of Cardiology by integrating clinical symptoms and signs with inpatient register entries and use of cardiac medications. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for major potential confounders. RESULTS: During the 6534 person-years of follow-up (mean, 5.02 years per person), 440 subjects were diagnosed as having dementia, including 333 with Alzheimer disease. At baseline, heart failure was identified in 205 subjects. Heart failure was associated with a multi-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.51) for dementia and 1.80 (95% CI, 1.25-2.61) for Alzheimer disease. Use of antihypertensive drugs (83% of which are diuretics) seemed to reduce dementia risk due to heart failure (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.99-1.94). Heart failure and low diastolic pressure (< 70 mm Hg) had an additive effect on the risk for dementia (HR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.67-5.61). CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease in older adults.

JOUR,"OBJECTIVE: It is known that dementia is a multi-factorial disorder, but the etiological factors other than aging remain to be explored, hence we sought to investigate the risk factors of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We followed a community-based dementia-free cohort (n = 1301) aged 75 years and over in Stockholm, Sweden. Baseline data were obtained through a structured interview and extensive clinical examination, or by reviewing the inpatient register database. We used the DSM-III-R criteria to define dementia and AD cases. RESULTS: Over six years of a follow-up program,350 subjects were diagnosed as dementia, including 260 Alzheimer cases. Multiple Cox regression analysis suggested that older age,low education (< 8 years), cognitive impairment, functional disability (ADL > or = 1), low diastolic pressure (< 70 mm Hg), diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and APOEepsilon4 allele were significantly or marginally associated with subsequent development of dementia and AD. Dementia was related also to stroke and atrial fibrillation. Antihypertensive drug use was associated with a lower risk of AD and dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that some sociodemographic features, cognitive and physical dysfunctions, vascular disorders, and genetic susceptibility were major risk factors for dementia and AD.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND: Many cardiovascular risk factors are shown to increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the impact of heart disease on later development of dementia is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the long-term risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) related to midlife and late-life atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) in a population-based study with a follow-up of over 25 years. METHODS: Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study includes 2000 participants who were randomly selected from four separate, population-based samples originally studied in midlife (1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987). Re-examinations were carried out in 1998 and 2005-2008. Altogether 1,510 (75.5%) persons participated in at least one re-examination, and 127 (8.4%) persons were diagnosed with dementia (of which 102 had AD). RESULTS: AF in late-life was an independent risk factor for dementia (HR 2.61, 95% CI 1.05-6.47; p = 0.039) and AD (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.04-6.16; p = 0.040) in the fully adjusted analyses. The association was even stronger among the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 non-carriers. Late-life HF, but not CAD, tended to increase the risks as well. Heart diseases diagnosed at midlife did not increase the risk of later dementia and AD. CONCLUSION: Late-life heart diseases increase the subsequent risk of dementia and AD.

JOUR,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is expected to soar as the average life expectancy increases, but recent estimates suggest that the age-specific incidence of dementia is declining in high-income countries. Temporal trends are best derived through continuous monitoring of a population over a long period with the use of consistent diagnostic criteria. We describe temporal trends in the incidence of dementia over three decades among participants in the Framingham Heart Study. METHODS: Participants in the Framingham Heart Study have been under surveillance for incident dementia since 1975. In this analysis, which included 5205 persons 60 years of age or older, we used Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age and sex to determine the 5-year incidence of dementia during each of four epochs. We also explored the interactions between epoch and age, sex, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, and educational level, and we examined the effects of these interactions, as well as the effects of vascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease, on temporal trends. RESULTS: The 5-year age- and sex-adjusted cumulative hazard rates for dementia were 3.6 per 100 persons during the first epoch (late 1970s and early 1980s), 2.8 per 100 persons during the second epoch (late 1980s and early 1990s), 2.2 per 100 persons during the third epoch (late 1990s and early 2000s), and 2.0 per 100 persons during the fourth epoch (late 2000s and early 2010s). Relative to the incidence during the first epoch, the incidence declined by 22%, 38%, and 44% during the second, third, and fourth epochs, respectively. This risk reduction was observed only among persons who had at least a high school diploma (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.88). The prevalence of most vascular risk factors (except obesity and diabetes) and the risk of dementia associated with stroke, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure have decreased over time, but none of these trends completely explain the decrease in the incidence of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants in the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of dementia has declined over the course of three decades. The factors contributing to this decline have not been completely identified. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",26863354,"['Satizabal, C. L.', 'Beiser, A.

JOUR,"Objective: To estimate prevalence, incidence, and rate of progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia and correlated vascular risk factors with incident MCI and its progression to dementia. Methods: The authors evaluated 2,963 individuals from the population-based sample of 5,632 subjects 65 to 84 years old, at the first (1992 to 1993) and second survey (1995 to 1996) of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), with a 3.5-year follow-up. Dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), other types of dementia, and MCI were classified using current clinical criteria. Results: Among the 2,963 participants, 139 MCI patients were diagnosed at the first ILSA survey. During the 3.5-year follow-up, 113 new events of MCI were diagnosed with an estimated incidence rate of 21.5 per 1,000 person-years.

Furthermore, age was a risk factor for incident MCI (RR: 5.93, 95% CI: 3.17 to 11.10), while education was protective (RR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.10), and serum total cholesterol evidenced a borderline nonsignificant trend for a protective effect. There was a nonsignificant trend for stroke as a risk factor of progression of MCI to dementia.

JOUR,"Background -Increased risk of dementia after myocardial infarction (MI) may be mediated by shared risk factors (e.g., atherosclerosis) and post-MI stroke. We examined risk of dementia in 1-year survivors of MI. Methods -Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all patients with first-time MI and a sex-, birth year-, and calendar year-matched general population comparison cohort without MI (1980-2012). Cox regression analysis was used to compute 1-35 year adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for dementia, controlled for matching factors and adjusted for comorbidities and socioeconomic status. Results -We identified 314,911 patients with MI and 1,573,193 matched comparison cohort members randomly sampled from the general population (median age 70 years, 63% male). After 35 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of all-cause dementia in the MI cohort was 9% (2.8% for Alzheimer's disease, 1.6% for vascular dementia, and 4.5% for other dementias). Compared with the general population cohort, MI was not associated with all-cause dementia (aHR = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.03).
